// ConnectorStepUp.swift — WS-F S3 (PKT-800)
// NotionBridge · Modules · Auth
//
// Three additive-isolation primitives for the remote `/mcp` connector
// funnel ONLY. Nothing here is constructed or consulted by stdio, legacy
// SSE (`/sse`+`/messages`), `/health`, the job callback, or local tool
// dispatch — they are reached exclusively from the post-bearer connector
// dispatch shim in `SSEServer`, gated behind the Optional
// `ConnectorAuthContext` that is `nil` in every default (stdio-only)
// configuration. With `BRIDGE_ENABLE_HTTP` unset every existing transport
// stays byte-for-byte behaviour-identical.
//
//   1. ConnectorStepUpGate — step-up consent on `destructiveHint: true`
//      tools. Base bearer + scope is necessary but NOT sufficient to
//      dispatch a destructive connector tool; an explicit, verifiable
//      step-up signal is additionally required. Absent ⇒ a structured,
//      machine-readable refusal (no dispatch).
//
//   2. ConnectorSessionBinding — confused-deputy isolation. A verified
//      bearer's (subject, client) identity is bound to the MCP session on
//      first authorized use; a later request on that session carrying a
//      DIFFERENT identity is rejected, so a token minted for one connector
//      client/session cannot act through another's session.
//
//   3. ConnectorAuthDiagnostics — the redaction-asserting sink. The
//      connector path emits structured events here instead of printing
//      raw material; a value is recorded ONLY through `redact()`, which
//      strips bearer/verifier/secret shapes, so the bearer-leak sweep can
//      capture every auth-path event and assert zero secret occurrences.
